About BNB
BNB is a cryptocurrency that can be used to trade and pay fees on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. BNB is also the cryptocurrency coin that powers the BNB Chain ecosystem. As one of the world's most popular utility tokens, BNB is useful to users in a wide range of applications and use cases.
BNB was launched through an Initial Coin Offering (or ICO) that took place from June 26th to July 3rd, 2017 - 11 days before the Binance Exchange opened for trading. The issue price was 1 ETH for 2,700 BNB or 1 BTC for 20,000 BNB. Although BNB was launched through an ICO, BNB does not provide users with a claim on Binance profits and does not represent an investment in Binance.   
With various applications both within the BNB Chain ecosystem and beyond, BNB serves numerous purposes. Originally launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB has now migrated to the main BNB Chain. Although the initial total supply was set at 200 million coins, the supply is gradually decreasing as a result of frequent coin burns. The current price of BNB is updated and available in real-time on Binance.
