About Polygon (MATIC)
Polygon (MATIC) is a layer 2 scaling solution designed to build upon the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating higher transaction throughput and lower transaction costs. Formerly known as the Matic Network, Polygon aims to create the blockchain infrastructure necessary to deploy and use Etheruem-based decentralized applications (DApps) at scale. 
Functioning as an add-on to the Ethereum blockchain, Polygon uses scaling solutions in order to increase the size, capacity, security, and efficiency of the Etheruem network. The Polygon platform is a multi-level system that creates sidechains upon which transactions are executed before they are merged with the main Ethereum chain, reducing the overall load on the Ethereum network.
Polygon integrates multiple sidechain solutions, including plasma chains, which consolidate transactions into a single batch and commit them to the Etheruem blockchain; ZK-Rollups, which integrate multiple transactions into a single transaction; and optimistic roll-ups, which integrate and scale smart contracts.
The Polygon ecosystem is designed to provide users with the ability to create DApps, services, and platforms on Ethereum without high fees or slow transaction speeds. Polygonâ€™s use cases include decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, blockchain-based games, and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. Polygon price is updated and available in real-time on Binance.
