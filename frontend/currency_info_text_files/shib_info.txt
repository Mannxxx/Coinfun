About Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an altcoin launched in 2020 on the Ethereum blockchain by an anonymous individual or group known only as Ryoshi. Altcoins are generally defined as any token or coin besides Bitcoin.
Shiba Inu is completely community-run and was called the “Dogecoin Killer” when it was first released. While both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin were launched as memecoins, they have since made a splash in the cryptocurrency world and begun developing utility for decentralized protocols and the wider crypto community.

The SHIBArmy is a community of SHIB holders and supporters whose members are encouraged to give guidance to the community.
